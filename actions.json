Triggers like Take Someone Out or Show Off probably apply here.<br> On a 9 or lower, you miss your shot and choose one of the following:<ul><li>Get shot, taking harm as established</li><li>You duck or weave out of the way and an NPC bystander, important object, or item of the GM’s choice (could be something you’re holding or wearing) takes grievous and lasting harm. If you shot first, the blame for this falls on you. If not, it falls on your opponent.</li></ul>On a 10-19, your shot hits, dealing harm as established. If you shot first, your target doesn’t get a chance to respond. If you didn’t shoot first, take harm as established.<br>On a 20+, your shot instantly kills your opponent (intentionally or not!). If you shot first, you shoot them before they even get a chance to draw, and folk present squarely place the blame for the death on you. If you didn’t shoot first, you are seen as acting at least partly in self defense.<br>If both parties agree, you might go through another round if the duel is not finished after the first round and both of you are still alive."
