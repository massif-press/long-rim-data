It might be a bit too cute but it’s the name our cask spat out for us. We observed Didymos Prime in action during the fall of Green Zone Alhambra, mounted in a chassis we initially classified as a HORUS Minotaur PG, one of three we ID’d operating among the Ungrateful cell in New Madrassa.<br>It was not that Minotaur.<br>Alhambra fell in three days. The Armory wasn’t keen to give it up, but decided to cut their losses and pull back rather than hold for reinforcements. We moved in after, during the looting. Our local contact [][][][][][][][] escorted us to the New Madrassan commanders, introduced us to them, and secured an audience with the pilot of the chassis.<br>I’m sure you’ve reviewed the records of the debrief we recorded. We don’t know how it arrived in New Madrassa; the Ungratefuls say they received the initial code burst from their contact in the Voladores. The Voladores deny this; the entity, however, conforms to their descriptions of an entity called “la pulga,” or, “The Flea.” We have designated it LITCH. Didymos is the active animus: what serves as its pilot.<br>We have taken the entity into custody. We do not recommend giving this one a long leash.",
