    "description": "This setting expansion for Lancer features a wealth of information on the Long Rim sector of space, including: Two new talent, Spaceborn, and Black Thumb for pilots who want to excel in null-gravity combat. And access to six additional mechs to pilot, in addition to their unique gear: The proud, memory-driven ATLAS, favored by Sparri espadas and Karrakin knights; The resourceful KOBOLD, the messy face of liberation for many across Baronic space; The storied ZHENG, the chassis first crafted by the bodhisattva-saint Xiong Xiaoli; The brutal CALIBAN, IPS-N's new corridor-clearing chassis designed specifically for boarding actions; The Harrison Armory SUNZI, a battlefield manipulator built from stolen Volador tech; and the deathless LITCH, a timeless entity released from blinkspace to haunt our reality.",
